### TITLE: BOLTUâ€™S CHALLENGE FOR SONTU
> "BOLTU and SONTU are the two best friends. BOLTU was good at mathematics but SONTU was
weak, so he planned to give a mathematical challenge from their ongoing Operating Systems course.
He set a CPU scheduling problem for SONTU and told him to solve this with the C code for different
CPU scheduling algorithms for other purposes."
